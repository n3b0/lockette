<div class="intro">
  <p>🗝️</p>
    <p>Interdisciplinary research project by 𝚗ₑₐ ⁿᵒᶜ weaving together
    themes of digital privacy, cyber-feminism, grief, resistance, web art,
    identity, expression, archival, community and connection.</p>
    <p>Rooted in lived experience, <i>lockette.online</i> is a meta-archival
    project - like a conversation on journalling, - where storytelling, research,
    and personal expression meet in the digital realm to form their own aesthetic
    of privacy, inspired by vulnerability and love, the feeling you might have when
    you think of a heart-shaped key to a diary padlock.</p>
